                <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                    displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                    and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                    into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                    included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

                            HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:
                            November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)
                            May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)

                            HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and
                            standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on
                            September 12, 1996.
                            Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled
                            overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup
                            tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual
                            agreement between the two companies. A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that
                            in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.</p>

                            HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
                            Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden
                            Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed
                            Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.
                            Initially code-named "Cougar", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and
                            attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by
                            marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application
                            conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.
                            April 24, 1998
                            HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
                            December 24, 1999
                            HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as
                            HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.
                            May 2000
                            ISO/IEC 15445:2000 ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an
                            ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard falls in the domain of the ISO/IEC
                            JTC1/SC34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and
                            processing languages).
                            After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as development of the
                            parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early
                            and mid-2000s.</p>

                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                    document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide
                    Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                    fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
                    the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                    specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the
                    structural content.</p>

                <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming
                    language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
                    typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
                <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
                    JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast
                    majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
                    execute it.</p>

                <p>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and
                    developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.</p>
                <p>Ruby is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                    including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to the creator, Ruby
                    was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.</p>

                </header>
                <p>Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT
                    License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a
                    database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such
                    as JSON or XML for data transfer, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing. In addition to MVC,
                    Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including
                    convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.</p>
                <p>Ruby on Rails' emergence in the 2000s greatly influenced web app development, through innovative
                    features such as seamless database table creations, migrations, and scaffolding of views to enable
                    rapid application development. Ruby on Rails' influence on other web frameworks remains apparent
                    today, with many frameworks in other languages borrowing its ideas, including Django in Python,
                    Catalyst in Perl, Laravel and CakePHP in PHP, Phoenix in Elixir, Play in Scala, and Sails.js in
                    Node.js.</p>
